# Trials Abolishment Act
Many people both inside and outside of the April Knights have expressed discomfort with our Trials Law. This bill proposes to remove the Trial Laws entirely and replace it with a simpler Moderation Law.
 
## Section I - Law Changes

This bill introduces the Knight Moderation Law, in order to better define both the rules of conduct and who has the authority to take enforcing actions. The "RULES for everyone" and "RULES for Knights" found in this law will be mirrored in the #rules channel of the Discord server.
This bill removes the Trials Law, and will no longer considered an active Statute. The Trials Law message in our #laws channel (Discord message link: https://discord.com/channels/295643919553921035/524685686629203988/963879975931494450) will be edited to remove the document link and indicate the date that this bill passes to nullify the prior law.
