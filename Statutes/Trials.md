[Version: 1.1]: #

# Trials

If a Knight is accused of a crime by any trustworthy party, a fair trial is warranted. This law outlines the occasions in which a trial may be called for, who may comprise the jury, and what punishments they have the authority to mete out.

## Article 1 - Conditions

## Section I - Eligibility
Any sworn Knight of any station may petition for a trial. Any veteran Knight—one that has been sworn for at least a year and has participated in at least one Reddit April event—has the right to a trial, should they seek it, unless the Vindicaris Maximus law overrides this. Exile cannot be given to a veteran Knight without a trial or by a Vindicator's hand, but smaller punishments may be given without one.

## Section II - Occasion
A Knight may be accused of any of several misdeeds. Examples of misdeeds are listed below, but should not be contrived as comprehensive.

* Breaking any law that was fully in effect at the time of the crime.
* Conspiring against the Knights, either persons or goals of the Order.
* Leaking confidential information to antagonists of the Order.
* Being exceptionally unpleasant or rude to your fellow Knights.

## Article 2 - Procedure

## Section I - Security
Before the trial is conducted, if the Grandmaster or the Grand Inquisitor feel that a security risk warrants such actions, a Knight accused may have their privileges temporarily revoked. These may include access to any and all Knight exclusive communication channels. The temporary nature of this preemptive action must be made clear to the accused and any who may witness this. Actions taken for security purposes should not imply unproven guilt.

## Section II - Judicial party
A trial for a Knight shall consist of 5 tribunal members. If the accused is on the Upper or Lower Council, the tribunal must consist of officers. These members should be chosen to be as impartial as feasibly possible.
The moderator of the trial holds a lot of responsibility. The Grandmaster is the default choice for moderator. If the Grandmaster is accused, this responsibility may pass to the Grand Inquisitor. If it needs to be passed further, it passes to the First Ranger, First Herald, then First Builder in that order.
The moderator chooses the five tribunal members. Anyone who does not wish to be a member of the tribunal may decline the position with no adverse consequences, and another is chosen in their place. In the interest of balancing partiality, the accused may nominate tribunal members, but the moderator makes the final decision on who is chosen.

## Section III - Procedure
The moderator shall also be responsible for guiding the trial. There does not need to be any particular time limit, as this order is global, and arranging concurrent attendance may not be possible.
The moderator must allow all distinct sides of the trial a chance to make a statement, and grant all sides a chance for at least one rebuttal after all statements have been heard.
In all other details of the trial not specified in this document, the moderator has the authority to decide how to conduct the trial.

## Section IV - Decision
The tribunal is free to discuss their thoughts in private at any part of the trial. At least three of the five must agree on guilty or not guilty; abstinence is not permitted in this case. A majority of voters must agree on the appropriate punishment; abstinence is permitted here. In case of a tie, the moderator chooses. Prior discussion between the tribunal members is highly encouraged.
The Grandmaster as moderator has the right to grant clemency in punishment, overriding the tribunal decision. This power is vested in their elected position. If the Grandmaster is accused, no post-tribunal clemency is possible.

## Article 3 - Punishments

## Section I
A Knight found guilty of crimes may receive due penalty for their actions. Examples of those consequences are listed below, but should not be contrived as comprehensive. Combinations (such as warning and transfer) may occur as well.

* Warning / No action
* Public admonishment
* Demotion
* Removed from one or more divisions
* Transfer to another battalion
* Temporary mute or ban from any or all Knight communication
* Permanent ban and full exile from the April Knights
* Mothers will warn their children about you
