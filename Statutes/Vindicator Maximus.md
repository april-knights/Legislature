[Version: 1.1]: #

# Vindicator Maximus

## Article 1 - Rationale and Process

### Section I
The Grandmaster is the focal point of all information gathering, overt and covert; there are times when evidence gathered is shared with the two ruling bodies. There are times when this information can and will involve members of those bodies. Under these circumstances, the Grandmaster is under no obligation to share this information with either body as a group, as one or more members may be subjects of the intel. Consultation with at least one member of either the Herald, Builder, or Ranger is strongly encouraged.

### Section II
At the point where the Grandmaster has determined that the collected evidence of broken faith by a group of three or more Knights, specifically including one or more members of either Council, is sufficiently and utterly damning, yet the display and demonstration of said evidence would put other members at risk, the Grandmaster is empowered to attempt to designate a Knight of Sergeant rank or higher as Vindicator Maximus.

### Section III
The selectee must be willing to accept the responsibility before seeing any of the information; should they decline, the Grandmaster may choose another. Once there is a designated selectee, the Grandmaster will share all evidence with the chosen selectee, making the case for the need to activate a Vindicator. The selectee must then make the call to either accept the evidence, or reject the designation.
1. If the Selectee accepts the evidence and role of Vindicator Maximus, the appointment is immediate, without any requirement to consult either council beforehand.
1. If the Selectee declines the evidence as insufficient, the Grandmaster must wait at least 2 weeks before attempting again with the same selectee, with additional supportive evidence.

### Section IV
Once a Vindicator is active, their judgement is absolute, inviolate, and beyond question, as it is the result of conclusions between themselves, the Grandmaster, and potentially the Grand Inquisitor. Their mandate is to remove heresy or treason quickly, efficiently, and without theatrics. Anyone confronted by the Vindicator is required to be given one chance to confess. Genuine confessions and repentance by members outside the Order of the Ashen Blade result in loss of rank if any, and transfer to the Ashen Blade. Subjects who are at that time members of the Ashen Blade are expelled from the Order. Subjects who refuse to confess or feign lack of knowledge on the matter are expelled from the Order. Members who are expelled are banned from attempting to rejoin the order for no less than one calendar year, such that they are barred from participating in an least one April event.

### Section V
Should a person confronted by the Vindicator wish to challenge the Judgement, they have the burden to prove to the Vindicator (and only the Vindicator) they were acting under what they believed to be legitimate orders from a superior, with the assumption the Grandmaster was aware of their activities. Said proof would be screenshots of said exchanges, or provision of log files documenting said exchanges.

### Section VI
Limitations on this role are as follows:

1. The Grandmaster may not activate more than one Vindicator in a calendar year. Should the Grandmaster feel another must be designated in less time, they must first survive a confidence vote in both Councils
1. The designated Vindicator is only active as such for eight (8) calendar days.
1. The confirmed selectee is barred from running for the position of Grandmaster for 180 days after first being approached and agreeing to view the evidence.
1. The confirmed selectee is barred from being appointed to any position higher than their own for 180 days after completion of their eight (8) days as Vindicator.

## Article 2 - Council Challenge

### Section I
After the end of the eighth day and conclusion of the Vindicator’s actions, one or both Councils may challenge the action of the Grandmaster.

1. Upon the motion and second for a confidence vote, an open vote would be taken in the Lower Council, with all members, Lower and Upper, voting yea or nay.
1. Should the motion pass with a simple majority, the Councils would then select one member from each Council, excluding the person, if applicable, who was the Vindicator.
1. These two individuals would then be shown, in private, any and all materials that contributed to the activation of a Vindicator.
1. If required, the two individuals may also consult with the sources that provided the information, with the Grandmaster having the privilege of declining to divulge a singular source for operational security; all others would be subject to interview.

### Section II
Based on the results of the Council Challenge and Inquiry, one of two outcomes would result.

1. Should the two Council members be unable to fault the logic behind the actions leading up to the Grandmaster’s decision and Vindicator’s acceptance of the role, the Challenge fails. This also means that the Grandmaster does not need to win a subsequent confidence vote to activate another Vindicator within the next calendar year as described in Article 1, Section VI, Subsection A.
1. Should the Grandmaster’s logic be found to be faulty and therefore the Vindicator’s acceptance be questionable, the material is shared with the Councils, and after discussion and review of the material, a vote held.
    1. If the Councils’ vote in favor of the Grandmaster through a 3/5ths super majority, the Challenge fails, and the two Council members are barred from filling the same role in the future. This also means that the Grandmaster does not need to win a subsequent confidence vote to activate another Vindicator within the next calendar year as described in Article 1, Section VI, Subsection A.
    1. If the Councils’ vote against the Grandmaster, they are immediately stripped of rank and privilege, and the Succession Act leveraged to identify a Grandmaster Pro-Tem till a new election can be held.

## Article 3 - Implementation

### Section I
This act shall take effect as soon as voted and approved by both Councils.
