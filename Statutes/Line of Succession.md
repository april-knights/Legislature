[Version: 1.1]: #

# Line of Succession

### Section I
The Grandmaster has the power to appoint any member of the Upper Council his regent and should inform both Councils of how long he will be absent for. Should the Grandmaster arrive earlier, the regency shall end and the Grandmaster assume command once again. The regent can hold their office of regent for ninety (90) days until they must forfeit the regency and the powers of the Grandmaster shall proceed down the line of succession outlined in this act.

### Section II
Should the office of the Grandmaster be vacated by any reason, the First Ranger shall assume the powers of the Grandmaster and serve as if in that position until the next election, or until the Grandmaster’s return/reinstatement.

### Section III
Should the First Ranger be unable to assume the responsibilities of the Grandmaster, the First Herald shall take the powers of the Grandmaster and hold them until the next election, or until a member of higher succession is able to assume the position.

### Section IV
Should both the First Ranger and First Herald be unable to assume the responsibilities of the Grandmaster, the First Builder shall take the powers of the Grandmaster and hold them until the next election, or until a member of higher succession is able to assume the position.

### Section V
Should the First Ranger, First Herald, and First Builder be unable to assume the responsibilities of the Grandmaster, the Commander with the most experience and the oldest battalion shall take the powers of the Grandmaster and hold them until the next election, or until a member of higher succession is able to assume the position.

### Section VI
If the Grandmaster does not make any public contact with either of the Councils or the knights as a whole for more than thirty (30) days without setting a regent, they will be considered “inactive” and the command will be temporarily passed down as detailed above. Public contact includes posts on the r/AprilKnights subreddit and public messages on the April Knights Discord server. During any period of war, such as an active April Event, the Grandmaster will be considered “Inactive” if they do not make any public contact for more than twenty-four (24) hours.

### Section VII
If the Grandmaster does not make contact of any kind with any knight for more than seven (7) days without giving prior notice to the Upper Council or establishing a regent, they will be considered “missing” and the command will be temporarily passed down as detailed above. During any period of war, such as an active April Event, the Grandmaster will be considered “missing” if they do not make any contact for more than sixteen (16) hours.

### Section VIII
This act shall take effect as soon as voted and approved by both Councils.
