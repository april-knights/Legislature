[Version: 1.0]: #

# Character and Language

## Article 1 - Language Standardization

### Section I
English is to be set as the standard for all official knight legislature and communications.

### Section II
Understanding that not every knight has an English background, let alone a background in the same regional variant of English, the utmost compassion and understanding is required when discussing syntactic and grammatical issues in Knight documents and communications. The violation of grammatical and syntactical rules is to always be given a lower priority than conveyed meaning. This also applies to the use of different regional variants of English, as meaning conveyed should always have more priority than adherence to a very inconsistent language.

### Section III
All legislation, in order to ensure accessibility to all inside the Order, should include an abstract at the beginning that summarizes the legislation’s intentions and actions in the most clear and easy to read diction possible, avoiding “legalese” whenever possible. This abstract does not serve to dictate official policy, but rather provide general insight into the function of said legislation in easily understood wording.

## Article 2 - Text Character Standardization

### Section I
Only ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) characters are to be used in official Knight documents. This avoids confusion and incompatibility with regionalized characters in other sets (e.g. Unicode).

## Article 3 - Implementation

### Section I
This act shall take effect as soon as voted and approved by both Councils, and confirmed by the Grandmaster.
