[Version: 1.0]: #

# Retirement

## Article I - Retirement

### Section I - Retirement Eligibility
All officers of the rank of Sergeant and above are eligible for retirement privileges given that they are in good standing with the Order of the April Knights. Officers who have previously left the Order but remain in good standing are retroactively eligible for retirement.

### Section II - Mechanics of Retirement
Officers who retire from the April Knights are to be recorded, either in a document or in the Squire. The ranks, years of service, and all other awards are kept to that Knight in perpetuity, unless that Knight performs actions against the Order of the April Knights. Commanders who return to service do not regain command of their battalion but receive a demotion to the next lowest rank (see Article 2 Section I). Commanders who step down from commanding a battalion without leaving the Order are demoted to the next lowest rank (A2SI).

## Article II - New Ranks

### Section I - Captain
A new rank of Captain will be made. These will be above Sergeants but below Commanders in the hierarchy. Captains are promoted from Sergeant through nomination of either the Grandmaster or a Commander and need to be approved by the Grandmaster and without objection from the Upper Council. The purpose of the Captains is to grant prestige to Knights who are befitting of being commanders without the need to raise battalions, to prepare Officers for commanding battalions if a new one needs to be raised, and to prepare more officers for service in either the Upper or Lower Council. Captains are bound to the same standards and expectations as Commanders as outlined in the Battalion Standardization Act (Bill 7-6)

### Section II - Rights and Responsibilities of Captains
Captains do not have additional responsibilities in their battalions beyond that of Sergeants. At the discretion of the Battalion Commander and as required, they can be designated as First Officer, and serve as Lower Council representatives. Otherwise, Captains will receive a seat on the Lower Council for observing and with speaking rights.

### Section III - Corporals
A new rank of Corporal will be made. These will be above Knight and below Sergeant in the hierarchy. Corporals are Knights who have either committed a notable deed in service of the Order or have dedicated years of service. Corporals are promoted from Knights at the discretion of their Commanders.

### Section IV - Rights and Responsibilities of Corporals
Corporals do not receive any additional rights or responsibilities in promotion from Knight.

## Article III - Implementation

### Section I
This act shall take effect as soon as it is voted and approved by both Councils and confirmed by the Grandmaster, pending any implementation requirements.
