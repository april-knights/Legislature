## Preamble
Our Order was founded in the days of the Button as a force of balance and a beacon of hope. We strive to spread the glory of our Order far and wide, to unite the people of Reddit towards a common goal, and to oppose the evil forces of chaos that seek to ruin the fun of the April Events.

3. The tribunal panel will consist of 5 members of the Lower and/or Upper Council decided amongst themselves based off of who would be the most impartial to the case.
4. During the proceedings, both the accuser and the accused will have an opportunity to present their case in that order. The tribunal panel will then be free to ask questions to either party or an outside one in order to ascertain any information needed.
5. Once both parties have pleaded their case and the panel has decided they have no more need for information, the panel will then come to a consensus based off of how they see fit. The panel is not only responsible for determining if the officer is impeached or not, but if the accusations warrant a punishment less severe than impeachment. Should the officer in question be impeached, the panel is also responsible for deciding said officer’s standing with the April Knights.
6. Should the accused be inactive, the Grandmaster or a member of either Council should take adequate measures to ensure the accused is informed of their trial. The accused, however, is not required to attend the proceedings should they choose not to.

### Section 2 - Purpose
