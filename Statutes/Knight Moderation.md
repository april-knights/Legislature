# Knight Moderation Law
This law describes how the April Knights may conduct issues of moderation. 
 
## Section I - Reasons
A person or Knight may be accused of any of several misdeeds. The rules that all members and Knights must follow are as follows (and also contained in our Discord server rules channel). 
### RULES for everyone
1. Remember the human. ~ We're mostly adults here; any hate speech, racist or sexist remarks, harassment, bullying, disruptive behavior, excessive arguing, or pure disrespect will not be tolerated.
1. Be tasteful. ~ No NSFW content allowed. Do not break Terms Of Service of any Knight platform (Reddit, Discord, etc), primarily the ones of ethical or moral concern.
Respect others' privacy. ~ Don't post private information or dox others. This will result in an immediate ban without warning.
1. Keep to relevant channels. ~ If uncertain, feel free to ask.
1. Don't spam or advertise. ~ Spamming is the rapid posting of the same or similar messages/pictures/links. Advertising or invitation links will lead to mod action. Malicious links will lead to a ban.
1. No trolling. ~ Lying to people isn't funny or "just a prank bro". If you want to be a troll, go somewhere else.
1. When in doubt, ask. ~ Any questions or concerns can be brought up to staff privately using the moderation-ticket channel. All Commanders and Upper Councilors are server moderators
1. Right of Moderation ~ All issues are dealt with on a case by case basis. Everything is left to the discretion of the moderation team and owners, and we reserve the right to deal with problems how we see fit. If you want to report a moderation issue, such as harassment, please open a #⁠moderation-ticket
### RULES for Knights
1. Follow the rules above.
1. Be kind ~ A true Knight is always honorable.
1. Listen to your superiors ~ Our discipline is where we get our strength. Always follow #⁠orders and #laws.
1. Keep it secret ~ Do not leak any material from channels that are not open to the public. Make sure whoever you are talking to is authorized to see the information you are discussing.
1. Loyalty above all ~ We rely on the loyalty of our knights. Do not take actions that may harm the Order or its members.
1. Uphold integrity ~ Do not abuse the powers and privileges granted to you by your rank or position.

NOTE: Abusing the powers of moderation granted within this law violates the tenet of "Uphold integrity", and therefore is also a misdeed.

## Section II - Knights

If the accused is a Knight but not an officer (currently defined as having a rank less than Sergeant), then any Commander, division head, or the Grandmaster may take moderation action against them, including timeout, mute, demotion, kick, or ban. 

Any moderation action must be logged in a place that can be viewed by all officers, such as the Lower Council, along with the reason for the action.

The accused may appeal this moderation action. Any Knight receiving an appeal from any accused party is mandated to report it to the Councils. The Councils may then choose to repeal, amend, or uphold the moderation action. A vote is held, and any change to the moderation action must pass a simple majority in both Councils. If a majority is not reached, the action is upheld by default.


It is recommended–but not required–that moderation actions be performed by the Knight’s battalion Commander. It is recommended that the commanding officer initiating this action consult with other officers or even the whole Council. And it is highly recommended that the commanding officer choose the lowest severity moderation action that is appropriate to the situation, i.e., mute before ban. 

Note that these powers are granted only to officers who actively wield the responsibility of command, and should not be taken lightly. The commanding officers are granted the power in this law to act quickly, recognizing that some situations require agile and decisive leadership. But for all other situations, the commanding officers imbued with these powers are expected to make moderation decisions with careful consideration and consulting the wisdom of multiple people.

## Section III - Officers

If the accused is a Knight officer, having a rank of Sergeant or higher, then any Commander, division head, or the Grandmaster may take limited moderation action against them, restricted to timeout or mute.

Further moderation, including demotion, kick, or ban, must be brought to a vote before both Councils. In the case of demotion, the exact type of demotion must be specified as part of the proposal.

In the case of an officer, they have the opportunity and the right to appeal the action during the process of the proposal. If an appeal was not made during the process, they retain the right of all Knights to appeal afterwards.

The proposed moderation must pass with an absolute majority in both Councils. If the accused is the Grandmaster, it must pass with a full two-thirds absolute majority in both Councils.

## Section IV - Non-Knights

If the accused is not a Knight, then any Knight officer, having a rank of Sergeant or higher, may take limited moderation action against them, restricted to timeout or mute. Any Knight commanding officer (battalion Commander, division head, or Grandmaster) may take any moderation action against them, including timeout, mute, demotion, kick, or ban. 

Any moderation action taken against a non-Knight must be logged in a place that can be viewed by all officers, such as the Lower Council, along with the reason for the action.

An exception is made for accounts that are suspected to be bots, such as fresh joins with no response. Any Knight officer is allowed to kick or ban these accounts. Logging is also not required in these cases.

The accused may appeal this moderation action. Any Knight receiving an appeal from any accused party is mandated to report it to the Councils. The Councils may then choose to repeal, amend, or uphold the moderation action. A vote is held, and any change to the moderation action must pass a simple majority in both Councils. If a majority is not reached, the action is upheld by default.
