# Legislation

## Article I - Legislative Procedure
How legislation is to be proposed, discussed, and passed within the April Knights organization.

### Section I - Proposing Legislation
Changes to proposed Legislation are permitted during the period after its submission to the Council considering it, whether in private Council chambers, or in the public Conclave. There is a minimum of two weeks for a piece of legislation to be officially proposed before it can be voted on. In the course of debate, changes or edits are permitted until one week before the voting period begins. Should it be required that changes be made during the last week leading up to the vote, the vote must be rescheduled so that another week may pass for public visibility. As outlined in the Constitution, the timing and scheduling limitations may be waived during an April event. See Appendix I for workflow.

### Section II - Discussing Legislation
All council members are to behave civilly and treat each other with respect worthy of all oathsworn Knights.

If any member of either council is found to be in violation of this act, a majority of the Triad have the full power to suspend any representative from partaking in as many sessions as they deem necessary.

The Grandmaster can bypass any suspension issued in this manner. When this bypass happens, the Grandmaster shall inform the Triad.

### Section III - Voting on Legislation
The Grandmaster should schedule a vote for legislation, waiting at least 2 weeks for public viewing. The Grandmaster should also ensure all battalion representatives are notified of the scheduled date of the vote.

The voting period will last exactly 48 hours from the selected starting time of the vote or until every representative has voted, whichever comes first. All votes will be counted; any representative that fails to vote either Aye or Nay will be counted as an abstention. During the tally, should the vote counts clearly show either passage or rejection, the result may be published while not ending the vote early.

During the 48 hour voting period, no comments, arguments, or qualifiers will be permitted regarding the legislation being voted on. The time of the first introduction and the 2 weeks of it under public review, to any time afterwards is where such action is permitted.
