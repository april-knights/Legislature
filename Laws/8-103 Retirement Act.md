# Retirement Act

Over the years many Knights have joined the Order and have left. Some Knights come and leave depending on how they feel about the April Fools Day event. The purpose of this legislation is to provide a system of retirement for officers of the April Knights to leave the order and maintain their earned prestige and to have the option of being furloughed.
