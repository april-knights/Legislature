# Line of Succession Act
On the rare occasion that our leader, the Grandmaster is inactive, missing, or removed, our Order should have a line of succession so we are never truly leaderless again like the events of the Interregnum like in the latter half of Grandmaster Wicroâ€™s reign. Avoiding these events will ensure we are never leaderless and broken during any period of time, be it the off season or during campaign.
