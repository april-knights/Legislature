# Constitutional Revision Act

This bill arrives in the wake of the Constitutional Rearrangement Act, [found here](/Laws/7-301%20Constitutional%20Rearrangement%20Act.md). This bill of revision aims to address the remaining areas in which the Constitution v2.0 needs improvement. This is the second and final phase of Constitutional changes intended at this time.

### Section I - Overview of changes

1. Trials and Impeachment is moved to its own law and removed from the Constitution.
1. Grandmaster eligibility widened to any officer with two years active experience.
1. Two advisor positions in Upper Council were made optional.
1. Expanded Upper Council change options to include election and resignation.
1. Added simple or absolute specifications to votes, and defined those terms.
1. The amendment for Arbiters was removed.
1. Removed “needs must”.

### Section II - Revised Constitution

This bill proposes a revised Constitution to include the changes outlined above. That document can be [found here](/Statutes/Constitution.md).

### Section III - New Trials law

This bill proposes a new law covering trials or impeachment. The procedure covered in this new law is significantly different than the prior version. The new law on Trials can be found here. This replaces the old Constitutional Article for trials and impeachment, which has been removed.

### Section IV - Enactment

This bill proposes a revision to the Constitution and a new law simultaneously. If passed, both the new law and the revised Constitution go into effect as soon as this bill is passed by both Councils. The revised Constitution and the new law may not take effect without the other.
