# Mutare Magia Act
As is expected, the Order needs must occasionally review and reflect on whether what is currently in place is providing the best desired effect. This, the Mutare Magia Act, or the Changing Magic Act, will help normalize how our coding Knights are organized, and supported, in addition to making adjustments to the relevant parts of the Constitution these changes touch on.

## Article 1 - Ranks and Titles
### Section I
The Rank of Necromancer was originally conceived as a permanent assignment, forever commanding our coding group. While recognizing the great contributions that Necromancer Abra/mncke has made in all of the Knightsâ€™ past campaigns, the reality of current and future obligations outside of the Order cannot be ignored. As such, this Act will change the Rank and Title of Necromancer to an Honorary Award, rather than that of a position. Any traditional school of Magic may be awarded as a title in this way for Mage work of the highest honors, as decided upon by the Grandmaster and head of Arcaenum.

### Section II
A new rank/title is to be created as the head of Arcaenum, appointed by the Grandmaster as part of the selection of the Upper Council, as defined in the Constitution. This title shall be Archmage, and shall be afforded all of the same privileges, rank, and responsibilities previously held by the title of Necromancer.

### Section III
The title of Mage has traditionally been reserved for members of the Arcaenum. This complicated things, as while the Arcaenum was represented, there is no presence in the Lower Council. This section changes current practice, such that any Knight, regardless of Battalion, may be afforded the Rank of Mage, without needing to transfer to the Arcaenum. Additionally, any current member of the Arcaenum may request membership in any of the other Battalions, without jeopardizing their spot in the Arcaenum.

## Article 2 - Chain of Command
### Section I
The new Chain of Command for Mages will be that operationally, they report to their Battalion Commander, who then reports to the Grandmaster. For all things related to Development or Code Design, Projects of similar scope, Support of Knight Systems, etc, they report to the Archmage, who reports to the Grandmaster.

### Section II
The Archmage is also obliged to keep the members of the Upper Council appraised of project statuses on an at least monthly basis. This is such that each of the Upper Council members will know how current and future projects can help them in their individual spheres.

## Article 3 - Arbiter Creation Amendment
### Section I
1. Defines and sets forth the powers and limitations of members of the new Specialty Battalion, the Arbiters.
2. Creates the Amendment wording to be explicitly inserted into the Constitution

### Section II
1. Appends to the end of the Constitution, after Article 6, [the following](/Statutes/Constitution.md#amendment-1).

## Article 4 - Additional Changes to Constitution
### Section I
* Article 2, Section 1, Paragraph 1 shall be edited [to read](/Statutes/Constitution.md#section-1-1).

### Section II
* Article 3, Section 1, Paragraph 1 shall be edited [to read](/Statutes/Constitution.md#section-1-2).

### Section III
* Article 3, Section 1, Paragraph 3 shall be edited [to read](/Statutes/Constitution.md#section-1-2).

### Section IV
* Article 3, Section 1, Paragraph 4 shall be inserted [to read](/Statutes/Constitution.md#section-1-2).

## Article 5 - Implementation
### Section I
This act shall take effect as soon as voted and approved by both Councils, and confirmed by the Grandmaster.
