# First Herald Renaming Act

As the April Knights grow and change as an organization, roles can change in meaning over time, and this bill hopes to reflect that as well as make other minor changes to the role currently known as the First Steward.

In the past, the First Steward was our foremost diplomat and steward of the image of our realm, however during LadyVulcan’s Grandmastership, their duties were changed to being the division leader of the Heralds, and as such, their name should reflect this change.

### Section I

The full list of changes are below, organized by document.

* April Knights Constitution
* Trials
* Line of Succession Act
* Vindicaris Maximus

In order to preserve the history of the Knights, one exception to the title renaming exists that shall not be changed: "First Steward Gryph", who is listed as the author of Vindicator Maximus.
