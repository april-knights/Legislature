# Mutare Magia Act
As is expected, the Order needs must occasionally review and reflect on whether what is currently in place is providing the best desired effect. This, the Mutare Magia Act, or the Changing Magic Act, will help normalize how our coding Knights are organized, and supported, in addition to making adjustments to the relevant parts of the Constitution these changes touch on.

## Article 1 - Ranks and Titles

### Section I
The Rank of Necromancer was originally conceived as a permanent assignment, forever commanding our coding group. While recognizing the great contributions that Necromancer Abra/mncke has made in all of the Knights’ past campaigns, the reality of current and future obligations outside of the Order cannot be ignored. As such, this Act will change the Rank and Title of Necromancer to an Honorary Award, rather than that of a position. Any traditional school of Magic may be awarded as a title in this way for Mage work of the highest honors, as decided upon by the Grandmaster and head of Arcaenum.

### Section II
A new rank/title is to be created as the head of Arcaenum, appointed by the Grandmaster as part of the selection of the Upper Council, as defined in the Constitution. This title shall be Archmage, and shall be afforded all of the same privileges, rank, and responsibilities previously held by the title of Necromancer.

### Section III
The title of Mage has traditionally been reserved for members of the Arcaenum. This complicated things, as while the Arcaenum was represented, there is no presence in the Lower Council. This section changes current practice, such that any Knight, regardless of Battalion, may be afforded the Rank of Mage, without needing to transfer to the Arcaenum. Additionally, any current member of the Arcaenum may request membership in any of the other Battalions, without jeopardizing their spot in the Arcaenum.

## Article 2 - Chain of Command

### Section I
The new Chain of Command for Mages will be that operationally, they report to their Battalion Commander, who then reports to the Grandmaster. For all things related to Development or Code Design, Projects of similar scope, Support of Knight Systems, etc, they report to the Archmage, who reports to the Grandmaster.

### Section II
The Archmage is also obliged to keep the members of the Upper Council appraised of project statuses on an at least monthly basis. This is such that each of the Upper Council members will know how current and future projects can help them in their individual spheres.

## Article 3 - Arbiter Creation Amendment

### Section I
1. Defines and sets forth the powers and limitations of members of the new Specialty Battalion, the Arbiters.
2. Creates the Amendment wording to be explicitly inserted into the Constitution

### Section II
1. Appends to the end of the Constitution, after Article 6, [the following](../Statutes/Constitution.md#amendment-1):

> ## Amendment 1
>
> ### Section 1
> 1. The Grandmaster and Councils have created a new Battalion, the Arbiters.
> 2. This new Battalion Commander is selected in the same method as all other Commanders, through Upper Council vote and confirmation.
> 3. Members of the Arbiters are empowered to maintain Order across Knight communication platforms as designated and selected by the Upper Council.
> 4. Actions allowed include muting, kicking, or access restriction to individual or individuals failing to maintain discipline and decorum in accordance with posted rules.
>
> ### Section 2
> 1. Arbiters are granted access to most officially April Knight sponsored communication platforms
> 2. This does not include access to platforms dedicated to sub-groups within the Order
> 3. This access includes both the Upper and Lower Council chambers, whether for discussion or voting.
>
> ### Section 3
> 1. In order to maintain unimpeachable neutrality, Arbiters may not participate in public or semi public Partisan activities such as Lower or Upper Council debates.
> 2. As such, the Arbiters are the only Battalion to not have Lower Council representation.
> 3. This restriction in no way shape or form places any limitation on any Arbiter’s right to vote in Order wide polling, e.g. the Grandmaster elections.

## Article 4 - Additional Changes to Constitution

### Section II

> Each battalion commander will be a member of the Lower Council and is entitled to one vote with two exceptions: the Arcaenum, whose members should reside in other Battalions and be represented there, and the Arbiters whose impartiality must remain unimpeachable and therefore do not vote in either Council.

### Section III
* Article 3, Section 1, Paragraph 3 shall be edited [to read](../Statutes/Constitution.md#section-1-2):
> If a battalion commander has obligations in the Upper Council, the battalion's First Officer, whatever their official rank is, will take their Commander's place in the Lower Council.

### Section IV
* Article 3, Section 1, Paragraph 4 shall be inserted [to read](../Statutes/Constitution.md#section-1-2):
> Should there be a case where a Battalion is represented in the Lower Council by a First Officer and that individual is called to also serve on the Upper Council, the position of First Officer needs must be passed to the next individual worthy of the responsibility of serving in the Lower Council for their Battalion.

This act shall take effect as soon as voted and approved by both Councils, and confirmed by the Grandmaster.
