# Document Standardization Act v1.0
The Order, as a highly functioning and evolving body, often and constantly communicates with each other through written methods. This act serves as a set of standards for creating and maintaining all acts and laws passed by the April Knights. The first article ‘Version Standardization’ serves to create a set of standards for upholding document history through nomenclature. The second article ‘Maintenance Standardization’ simply aims to ensure any document created by the April Knights is not lost, altered, or erased without intention.
