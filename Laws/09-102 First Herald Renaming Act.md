# First Herald Renaming Act

As the April Knights grow and change as an organization, roles can change in meaning over time, and this bill hopes to reflect that as well as make other minor changes to the role currently known as the First Steward.

In the past, the First Steward was our foremost diplomat and steward of the image of our realm, however during LadyVulcan’s Grandmastership, their duties were changed to being the division leader of the Heralds, and as such, their name should reflect this change.

### Section I
The full list of changes are below, organized by document.

April Knights Constitution:
* Wording is changed in Article 2, Section 1, replacing “First Steward” with “First Herald”
Mutare Magic Act:
* Wording is changed in Article 4, Section 1, replacing “First Steward” with “First Herald”
Trials:
* Wording is changed in Article 2, Section 2, replacing “First Steward” with “First Herald”
Line of Succession Act:
* Wording is changed in Article 3, replacing “First Steward” with “First Herald”
* Wording is changed in Article 4, replacing “First Steward” with “First Herald”
* Wording is changed in Article 5, replacing “First Steward” with “First Herald”
Vindicaris Maximus:
* Wording is changed in Article 1, Section 1, replacing “First Steward” with “First Herald”

In order to preserve the history of the Knights, one exception to the title renaming exists that shall not be changed: "First Steward Gryph", who is listed as the author of Vindicator Maximus.

### Section II
An overview of changes made to the Document Standardization Act:
* Article 2, Section 1, is changed to the following: “For the sake of preservation of April Knights history, the First Herald will appoint any officer ranked Captain or higher, other than the Grand Inquisitor, with the charge of maintaining April Knights documents. This Knight will be known as the Scribe. The First Herald may choose themselves, and the Scribe duties outlined would fall on them during periods in which the Scribe position is unfilled. The Scribe position is not an Upper Council position.”

### Section III - Enactment
This bill will go into effect at the time in which it has been voted on and approved by both Councils.
